```bash
npm install
npm run dev

Reminder: 
The data and API call are totally mocked up. The data is harded-coded so there is no database used. That means you cannot really change the data but you can change the State on pages. I checked the requirement and that said I could use Mock-up API so I did that. If you want me to use a Firestore, just tell me and I will fix it.
